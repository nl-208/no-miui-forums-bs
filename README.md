# No MIUI Forums BS
Cuts down on nonsense from the MIUI forum, making it easier to read.

* Removes the medal boxes. No longer will you have to scroll through half a page to get past one post.
* Removes all threads with Chinese characters in the titles from the thread list.
* Shrinks all smileys down to 20x20 from 48x48.
* View-obscuring stamps ("answered", "lucky draw", "dope", "original", etc.) are removed. You can still see the tags in the thread titles, so don't worry about not being able to find a specific thread or category.
