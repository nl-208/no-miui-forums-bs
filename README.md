# No MIUI Forums BS
Cuts down on nonsense from the MIUI forum, making it easier to read.

* Removes the medal boxes. No longer will you have to scroll through half a page to get past one post.
* Removes all threads with Chinese characters in the titles from the thread list.
* Shrinks all smileys down to 20x20 from 48x48.
* View-obscuring stamps ("answered", "lucky draw", "dope", "original", etc.) are removed. You can still see the tags in the thread titles.

# Greasemonkey
Don't try to use Greasemonkey with this script, as it will **NOT** work. In fact, most, if not all, userscripts do not appear to work with Greasemonkey anymore. Trying to install any script (not just NMFBS) will return an error.

Consider using [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) instead.

# Planned
* Simplify the ratings box.
* Add a context menu so you can turn each filter on or off.
